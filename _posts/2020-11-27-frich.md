Frich is the first social finance app founded by me and my co-founder and long time friend Katrin. It solves the issue that prior finance apps have missed - money is inherently social. When you are young, it is nearly impossible to save, if your friends are not in the same boat as you are. Frich allows its users to create savings goals together and keep each other accountable in their journey to tackle their social life spendings. 


We are currently working with a branding and design team to develop our identity. We have also secured a CTO - Tyler, who is a software engineering lead at GrubHub. Our mentor is Ken Kruszka, the founder of Snapcheck and we have some initial interest from Citi bankâ€™s Innovation division.
