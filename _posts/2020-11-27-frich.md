Frich is the first ever social finance app for Gen Z that disrupts the current conservative personal finance industry.  Frich stands out with its innovative and fun approach to solving personal finance problems by adding gamification and social elements. It solves the issue that prior finance apps have missed - money is inherently social. When you are young, it is nearly impossible to save, if your friends are not in the same boat as you are. Frich allows its users to create savings goals together and keep each other accountable in their journey to tackle their social life spendings.
