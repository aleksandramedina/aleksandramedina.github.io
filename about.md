I’m a student at NYU’s Interactive Media Program where I work both on my design and technical coding skills.


Leading up to today, I have worked and studied in multiple countries in Europe, China, UAE, and now eventually in New York.


During my gap year I worked at McCANN Erickson creating brand strategies for a wide variety of clients including cities, department stores and government entities.


After moving to New York, I started working at an agency, where some of my clients included Audi, Warner Music and the Amy Winehouse Foundation.


And now, while wrapping up my studies, my co-founder and I are working on Frich - the first social finance app, with our mentor Ken Kruszka, who is the founder of Snapcheck.
